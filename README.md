# Bubble Shooter Game

## Description

This is a classic **Bubble Shooter Game** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The objective of the game is to shoot colored bubbles and match three or more of the same color to clear them from the screen. The game continues until all bubbles are cleared or the bubbles reach the bottom of the screen.

## Features

- Simple and addictive gameplay.
- Colorful bubbles and responsive animations.
- Points system and score tracking.
- Mobile and desktop responsive design.
- Intuitive and easy-to-understand mechanics.

## How to Play

1. Click or tap to aim and shoot bubbles.
2. Match at least three bubbles of the same color to clear them.
3. The more bubbles you clear, the higher your score.
4. Keep shooting and clearing bubbles to prevent them from reaching the bottom.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bubble-shooter-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd bubble-shooter-game
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser:

   open index.html
   ```

You can now play the game in your browser!

## Usage

- **Pause/Restart**: Use the in-game buttons to pause or restart the game.
- **Customization**: You can modify the colors, add more levels, or change the bubble designs by editing the relevant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for the structure of the game.
- **CSS3** for styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript** for game logic, including bubble mechanics and collision detection.
- **HTML5 Canvas** for rendering the game screen and animations.

## How It Works

1. **Game Loop**: The game is controlled by a continuous game loop that updates the position of the bubbles and checks for collision.
2. **Bubble Generation**: New bubbles are randomly generated and added to the screen, which the player must shoot.
3. **Scoring**: The player earns points by clearing bubbles. The game ends when the bubbles fill the screen.
